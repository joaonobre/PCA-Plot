# PCA-Plot

Application of PCA to a multivariate Gaussian data set. Once the principal components in the data set are determined, the data can be projected on the principal components obtained.In this new space, the data points are uncorrelated and the principal components are now aligned with the coordinate axes.

What was done in this example using the PCA method was represent the original data set using the orthogonal eigenvectors instead of representing on normal x and y axes, classifying the original data set as a combination of contributions from x and y.
